Reporting issues
----------------

To report issues please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tdebaets/common/issues) on GitHub. This should only be used to report actual bugs. Please **do not use the issue tracker for anything else**, such as feature requests or questions!

Contributing new code
---------------------

If you want to contribute new code to a project, don't clone its main repository, but create your own fork first and clone that fork instead. Then commit your work on a topic branch and submit a pull request. In more detail:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project.

2. Clone your fork. In a Windows command prompt window, run:
  ```
  > git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git YOUR_FORK
  > cd YOUR_FORK
  > postclone.bat
  ```

3. Add an `upstream` remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/tdebaets/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git`.

4. Get the latest changes from upstream: `update.bat upstream master`.

5. [Create a new topic branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) on GitHub to contain your feature, change, or fix.

6. Checkout the new topic branch:
  ```
  > git fetch
  > git checkout TOPIC_BRANCH
  ```

7. While making changes, please take care to follow the coding conventions currently used in the file: indentation, capitalization, funtion/parameter/variable naming, explicatory comments where needed etc. All indentation should be saved as spaces and never as tabs. Please make sure that your text editor or IDE is set to use spaces.

TODO complete instructions

To keep your topic branch up-to-date with the changes from upstream, first make sure that you have committed your changes or `git stash` them. Then run `update.bat upstream master` again. Don't forget to `git stash pop` your changes again afterwards if needed.
